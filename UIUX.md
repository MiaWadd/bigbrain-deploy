# UI/UX Improvements and Principles

## Navigation and Flow

### Consistent Navigation
- Implemented a persistent `Navbar` component across all pages that adapts based on user role (admin/player)
- Clear navigation paths between related screens:
  - Dashboard → Edit Game → Edit Question for admin flow
  - Join → Lobby → Play → Results for player flow
- Back buttons and clear return paths to parent screens (e.g., "Back to Game" in EditQuestion)
- Breadcrumb-style navigation in complex flows (e.g., Dashboard > Game Name > Question)

### User Feedback
- Loading states for all async operations:
  - Spinner during game creation/editing
  - Loading overlay during question submission
  - Progress indicators during file uploads
- Error messages with clear explanations and recovery actions:
  - "Could not determine game owner. Please try logging out and back in."
  - "Failed to fetch game. Please check your connection and try again."
- Success confirmations for important actions:
  - "Game created successfully"
  - "Question saved successfully"
- Disabled states for buttons during processing to prevent double submissions
- Visual feedback for interactive elements:
  - Hover effects on buttons and cards
  - Focus states for keyboard navigation
  - Active states for clickable elements
