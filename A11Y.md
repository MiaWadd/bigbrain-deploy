# Accessibility Improvements

## Overview

Our application follows Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards to ensure it is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. We have implemented various accessibility features throughout the frontend to provide an inclusive user experience. Our commitment to accessibility is demonstrated by achieving 100% accessibility scores in Lighthouse audits for both mobile and desktop versions. This comprehensive approach ensures that our application is usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities or assistive technologies.

## Semantic HTML

### Proper Document Structure
- Used semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`) to provide clear structure and meaning to the content
- Implemented proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6) to create a logical document outline
- Used appropriate ARIA landmarks for navigation and content regions to help screen reader users understand the page structure
- Added descriptive alt text for all images to ensure non-text content is accessible to screen reader users
- Used semantic HTML5 elements to provide better structure and meaning to the content

### Form Accessibility
- Associated form labels with inputs using `htmlFor` and `id` attributes to ensure screen readers can properly announce form fields
- Used `aria-describedby` for additional form instructions to provide context for form fields
- Implemented error messages with `aria-invalid` and `aria-errormessage` to clearly indicate validation errors
- Added required field indicators with `aria-required` to inform users which fields must be completed
- Used appropriate input types (text, number, email, etc.) to provide the correct keyboard and validation behavior

Example from EditQuestion component:
```jsx
<label htmlFor="questionText" className="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700">
  Question Text
  <span className="text-red-500" aria-hidden="true">*</span>
  <span className="sr-only">(required)</span>
</label>
<textarea
  id="questionText"
  name="questionText"
  rows={3}
  className="mt-1 block w-full rounded-md border-gray-300 shadow-sm focus:border-blue-500 focus:ring-blue-500"
  value={questionData.text}
  onChange={(e) => setQuestionData({ ...questionData, text: e.target.value })}
  aria-required="true"
  aria-invalid={!!errors.text}
  aria-errormessage={errors.text ? "questionTextError" : undefined}
  aria-describedby="questionTextDescription"
/>
<p id="questionTextDescription" className="mt-1 text-sm text-gray-500">
  Enter the question text that will be displayed to players
</p>
{errors.text && (
  <p id="questionTextError" className="mt-2 text-sm text-red-600" role="alert">
    {errors.text}
  </p>
)}
```

## Keyboard Navigation

### Focus Management
- Implemented visible focus indicators for all interactive elements to make it clear which element has focus
- Used `tabIndex` appropriately for custom interactive elements to ensure they can be focused
- Added keyboard shortcuts for common actions to improve efficiency
- Ensured logical tab order throughout the application to provide a predictable navigation experience
- Maintained page navigation elements such as tab, enter, up/down keys using standard HTML elements
- Added skip links to allow keyboard users to bypass navigation and go directly to main content

### Interactive Elements
- Made all interactive elements keyboard accessible to ensure they can be used without a mouse
- Added keyboard event handlers for custom components to support keyboard interaction
- Implemented proper focus trapping in modals to prevent users from tabbing outside the modal
- Added skip links for main content to allow users to bypass navigation
- Used standard HTML elements (buttons, forms, inputs, nav, main, footer) for better accessibility
- Ensured all interactive elements have appropriate keyboard event handlers

Example from GameCard component:
```jsx
<button
  onClick={handleEdit}
  className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:ring-offset-2"
  aria-label={`Edit game ${game.name}`}
  onKeyDown={(e) => {
    if (e.key === 'Enter' || e.key === ' ') {
      e.preventDefault();
      handleEdit();
    }
  }}
>
  <span className="sr-only">Edit</span>
  <svg className="h-5 w-5" aria-hidden="true" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 20 20">
    <path d="M13.586 3.586a2 2 0 112.828 2.828l-.793.793-2.828-2.828.793-.793zM11.379 5.793L3 14.172V17h2.828l8.38-8.379-2.83-2.828z" />
  </svg>
</button>
```

## Screen Reader Support

### ARIA Attributes
- Added appropriate ARIA roles and states to provide additional context for screen reader users
- Used `aria-live` regions for dynamic content to announce changes to screen reader users
- Implemented `aria-expanded` for collapsible sections to indicate their current state
- Added `aria-controls` for interactive elements to indicate which elements they control
- Used `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` to provide descriptive labels for elements

### Dynamic Content
- Used `aria-live` regions for real-time updates to ensure screen reader users are informed of changes
- Added appropriate ARIA announcements for state changes to provide context
- Implemented proper focus management for dynamic content to ensure keyboard users can interact with new content
- Used `aria-busy` for loading states to indicate when content is being updated
- Ensured all dynamic content is properly announced to screen reader users

Example from Lobby component:
```jsx
<div 
  aria-live="polite" 
  aria-busy={loading}
  className="text-center p-4"
>
  {loading ? (
    <p>Loading game status...</p>
  ) : (
    <p>Waiting for game to start...</p>
  )}
  <div className="mt-4">
    <p className="text-lg font-medium" aria-live="polite">
      {quotes[currentQuoteIndex]}
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Color and Contrast

### Color Contrast
- Ensured sufficient color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text) to make text readable
- Used color combinations that meet WCAG standards to ensure accessibility
- Implemented high contrast mode support for users who need it
- Added visual indicators beyond color to ensure information is not conveyed by color alone
- Used Lighthouse to ensure all elements had sufficient contrast and followed WCAG contrast guidelines
- Tested color combinations with color contrast checkers to verify compliance

### Visual Hierarchy
- Used size, weight, and spacing for visual hierarchy to create a clear structure
- Implemented clear visual separation between elements to improve readability
- Added visual indicators for interactive elements to make them distinguishable
- Used consistent visual patterns to create a predictable interface
- Followed standard color conventions (e.g., red for delete, green for success) to provide clear meaning
- Used multiple visual cues (color, shape, size) to convey information

Example from Play component:
```jsx
<div 
  className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900" 
  role="heading" 
  aria-level="1"
  tabIndex="0"
>
  {questionData.text}
</div>
<div className="mt-4 space-y-4">
  {questionData.answers.map((answer, index) => (
    <button
      key={index}
      className={`w-full p-4 text-left rounded-lg border ${
        selectedAnswers.includes(index)
          ? 'border-blue-500 bg-blue-50 ring-2 ring-blue-500'
          : 'border-gray-300 hover:border-blue-500 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500'
      }`}
      onClick={() => handleAnswerSelect(index)}
      onKeyDown={(e) => {
        if (e.key === 'Enter' || e.key === ' ') {
          e.preventDefault();
          handleAnswerSelect(index);
        }
      }}
      aria-pressed={selectedAnswers.includes(index)}
      aria-label={`Answer ${index + 1}: ${answer}`}
    >
      {answer}
    </button>
  ))}
</div>
```
